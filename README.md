# 🦠 COVID-19 Data Analytics & Visualization (SQL + Tableau)

An end-to-end analytics project exploring the global impact of COVID-19 through **SQL-based data processing** and **Tableau visualization**. It analyzes real-world data to uncover trends in infection rates, mortality, and regional spread, transforming raw datasets into actionable insights.

---

### 🌍 Key Features
- **Global Overview:** Total cases, deaths, and death percentage to summarize the pandemic’s scope.  
- **Interactive Map:** Visualizes continent- and country-level impact through color-coded severity.  
- **Top Infected Nations:** Highlights countries like **Andorra**, **Montenegro**, and **Czechia** with the highest per-capita infection rates.  
- **Time Trends:** Line charts show daily and cumulative case growth across the globe.  
- **Regional Comparison:** Evaluates deaths and infection percentages by continent.

## 🧠 Data & Analysis
Raw COVID-19 data was cleaned and aggregated in **SQL** to compute key indicators like **death rate** and **percent population infected**, then visualized in Tableau for deeper exploration of trends, anomalies, and high-impact regions.

---

## ⚙️ Tools Used
- **SQL** – Data cleaning, joins, aggregations, metric calculations  
- **Tableau** – Interactive dashboard and storytelling  
- **Excel** – Pre-visualization data prep and validation  

---

## 💡 Key Insights
- Over **150M total cases** and **3.18M deaths** globally (~**2.1%** death rate).  
- Europe saw the highest death counts; the Americas followed.  
- Smaller, denser nations faced higher infection percentages.
